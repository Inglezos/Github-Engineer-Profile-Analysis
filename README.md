# PatternRecognition_GithubEngineerProfiling
Software engineer profile recognition through application of data mining techniques on GitHub

This project, part of my semester course "Pattern Recognition" (Winter 2017), is about analyzing and processing a variety of open-source software repositories data that have been already mined and trying to categorize them into groups, depending on their characteristics and features. More specifically, the issue is to observe among the data the profiles that the software engineers (contributors) can have and further divide them into subcategories, extracting many more details about their skills and traits, using some metrics and thus, hopefully, develop approximately their personal repository profile.
