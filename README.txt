1) Set the current working directory and read the dataset into the R environment.

2) Open the Inglezos_Charalampos_8145_Pattern_Recognition_Project_Code.R script file.

3) Execute the commands one-by-one and follow the further instructions that I have included thoroughly there in the form of comments, perhaps modifying/adjusting them properly.

4) Generally, (at some point) you will need to execute the included script files:

	i) "impute_NA.R"
	ii) "kmeans_k.R"
	iii) "fanny_k.R"
	iv) "diana_k.R"
	v) "hclust_k.R"
	vi) "pam_k.R"
	vii) "pam_routine.R"
	viii) "pam_dev_routine.R"
	ix) "pam_ops_routine.R"
	x) "pam_devops_routine.R"


5) The reader should make sure to check also the other scripts I have included (in the .zip file) for a complete realization of my work.

6) Finally, the readers should be free to experiment and see for themselves the boxplots produced by the different clustering models I created and that are described in my detailed report of my assignment.

8) Note: Since the .RData files are too large, I preferred to include only the latest version and not previous ones.
